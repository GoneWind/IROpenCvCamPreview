- The Camera View is implemented with JavaCameraView from the OpenCV Library.
- The Camera View can be zoomed/panned using touch.
- A 16x4 color grid is superimposed on top of the Camera View to display reading from IR sensors. The "redder" the color indicates higher IR readings.
- Currently the data of the IR grid are random numbers from 0.0f to 1.0f fed by a stub function.
